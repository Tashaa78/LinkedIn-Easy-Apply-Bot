# Disclaimer

I do not take credit of this code, all I did was to make it work for me. The original repo can be found <a href="https://github.com/nicolomantini/LinkedIn-Easy-Apply-Bot">here</a>

## How it works

This particular version uses a resume that's already stored on your LinkedIn meaning it will not upload the resume you set in the config. LinkedIn XPaths change every now and then so if if it doesn't work the time you use this, please jus debug and make sure the XPath values are returning valid elements.

Enjoy
